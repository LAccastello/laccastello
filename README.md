### Hi!! I'm Lucas 👋

I'm Full Stack Engineer focused in **Javascript** specifically **Angular, React & Node**. I'm from Argentina and currently working on [Intuitivo](http://intuitivo.ai). I'm looking to spend more time sharing knowledge and collaborating on OpenSource projects 🤟. 

I’m currently learning about containers with Docker and Kubernetes and how to create Microservices in a professional way 💪 on [MUG](http://mug-it.org.ar/) 

Also I write posts about programming [at my blog](https://lucasaccastello.dev) 📝
